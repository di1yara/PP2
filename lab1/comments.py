#Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
#Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
#Comments can be used to explain Python code.
#Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it 
#can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
#you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
